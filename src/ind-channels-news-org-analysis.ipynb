       "2  Get creative in the way you #RESIST\\nThey don’t want you to realize your power.\\nSo use it.\\n\\nBLEEDING AMERICA is an original makeup look designed by AUDFACED. Originally created in 2016 shortly after the election of the 45th President of the United States. I held onto this footage through much procrastination thinking of a better time to post it … President’s Day … Columbus Day / Indigenous People’s Day … 4th of July (twice) but as the big Midterm Elections of 2018 came I realized this was the time. Whether it’s voting season or not, I hope this piece can continually inspire and remind you that you are part of this world and you have been given unique gifts that you can use to do good in creative ways.\\n\\nMuch love and light.\\n\\nAUD xo\\n\\n#AUDFACED #BLEEDINGAMERICA\\n\\nMUSIC is “Nightmare”\\nNEO FRANCE\\nUsed With Permission\\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neofrance/neo-nightmare\\nThank You!\\n\\nPlease check out my political music video CRYING LIBERTY, a story that explores Lady Liberty in a demented America, exploring her sunken worlds searching to find her voice, regain her crown and remember who she is.\\nProduced by AUDFACED + Risha Dee Films.\\n\\nWATCH “Crying Liberty” MUSIC VIDEO:\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yg027-X7BY\\n\\nFREE DOWNLOAD\\n“Crying Liberty” SONG:\\nhttps://soundcloud.com/audfaced/crying-liberty\\n\\nAUDFACED LINKS\\n\\nI really like updating daily on Instagram.\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/audfaced\\n\\nMy Self Love Page, @ SPUNK MIND\\nIG: http://instagram.com/spunkmind/\\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/spunkmind\\n\\nTweeting makes me feel clever.\\nhttps://twitter.com/AUDFACED\\n\\nFacebook is kinda messy with the drama but classic.\\nhttp://facebook.com/audfaced\\n\\nMy Boujee Website\\nhttp://www.AUDFACED.com   \n",

So please stop with the hateful comments.\\n\\nI'm sorry I got some of my words mixed up.Before I filmed this video I watched the video again and put myself in the state of mind that I was one of those people trying to escape and seeing my brother that's trying to escape with me get murdered. I started tearing up and started to film. Here is the video you must see this...\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc\\nShare this video with your friends. They need to see this.\\n\\nThis video is to make Joseph Kony famous, not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice.\\nPledge your support at http://bit.ly/konydonate\\n\\nI'm happy I can help by making this video. Tell others about Kony on Facebook Twitter or on anything...   \n",

I AM TEARING UP IN THIS VIDEO FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE KIDS. I'm starting to have second thoughts about the video but I don't know for sure but I did not know that this did happened to many kids. So please stop with the hateful comments.\\n\\nI'm sorry I got some of my words mixed up.Before I filmed this video I watched the video again and put myself in the state of mind that I was one of those people trying to escape and seeing my brother that's trying to escape with me get murdered. I started tearing up and started to film. Here is the video you must see this...\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc\\nShare this video with your friends. They need to see this.\\n\\nThis video is to make Joseph Kony famous, not to celebrate him, but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice.\\nPledge your support at http://bit.ly/konydonate\\n\\nI'm happy I can help by making this video. Tell others about Kony on Facebook Twitter or on anything...   \n",
