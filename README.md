# Youtube, the mirror of society?

## Abstract
Our main goal will be to determine whether YouTube is a reflection of the events of the world. Thanks to the increasing and large presence of mainstream media on YouTube, the platform can be considered as a source of information (even the primary one for a lot of people). Therefore, it would be interesting to observe if it can be considered as reliable source and does it cover a large number of events or mainly focus in certain types of events. Thereby, by determining whether YouTube is a reliable and diverse source of information in terms of different opinions and topics, we would be able to consider YouTube as a good source of information or not. It is important to answer these questions because now the concept of fake news is very important and can propagate very easily thanks to platform like YouTube.


Youtube has grown into a major source of information over the decade, with its main attributes being selectivity and anonymity. According to a study by G.Stocking et al.(2020), a quarter of USA citizens consider Youtube as being an important news outlet, while being as likely to turn to independent channels as they are to established news organizations. Since the way  to succeed on Youtube is strictly getting more views on videos, an important amount of misinformation and bias is suspected from the creators. 
Therefore, our goal is to “inspect” whether Youtube is a reliable and diverse source of information. By “reliable”, whether it covers a large number of issues, or it only focuses on certain types of events, and by “diverse”, whether it provides different point of views or it reinforces a biased opinion on a specific topic. It seems to be an interesting lead, since the platform users encounter a flood of information on a daily basis, and it often creates confusion in the public perception of the issue. 


## Research questions: 
- Does YouTube reflect what’s happening in the world ? 
- Which events are the most popular ? 
- Are controversial topics the most popular ? 
- Are the most popular topics on Youtube the same as for an another media/social media ? 

- Does Youtube reflect the events that occur off screen?
- Which events catches the public eye the most?
- Do controversial topics get more attention?
- Are the most discussed topics on Youtube also relevant on other social media/news outlets?

## Additional datasets

## Methods
First of all, we would like to proceed a time series analysis to determine which topics were the most discussed at a certain time period. We would then compare these topics to an additional data set that contains imporant events that occurred in the world during the same time period. Thereby, we would be able to examine if Youtube puts enough emphasis on the important subjects in real life. In order to quantify the amplitude of the event, we would like to quantify the number of people affected by the event. We would focus on events that have only occurred in English-speaking regions, since the original data set only includes English YouTube channels. To determine which topic is discussed in each video, we would analyze the tags, the description and the title of the video. 

Second, we would determine whether a topic is controversial or not by computing the dislike/like ratio. If this ratio is large, we will consider the topics and opinions of a video as being controversial. By doing that, we will be able to classify videos according to how controversial they are. Then, we could compare the two datasets that we have obtained and determine whether there is a correlation between the variables.

Then, we could further analyze the percentage of independent channels and news organization channels in the news/politics category, as well as the average views and subscribers they have, in order to observe how much people actually consider Youtube as being an important source of information. Also, we could compare the different narratives that they are painting, by
