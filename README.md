# Abstract
Our main goal will be to determine whether YouTube is a reflection of the events of the world. Thanks to the increasing and large presence of mainstream media on YouTube, the platform can be considered as a source of information (even the primary one for a lot of people). Therefore, it would be interesting to observe if it can be considered as reliable source and does it cover a large number of events or mainly focus in certain types of events. Thereby, by determining whether YouTube is a reliable and diverse source of information in terms of different opinions and topics, we would be able to consider YouTube as a good source of information or not. It is important to answer these questions because now the concept of fake news is very important and can propagate very easily thanks to platform like YouTube.

# Research questions: 
- Does YouTube reflect what’s happening in the world ? 
- Which events are the most popular ? 
- Are controversial topics the most popular ? 
- Are the most popular topics on Youtube the same as for an another media/social media ? 

# Additional datasets

# Methods
Firstly, we will do a time series analysis to determine which topics were the most popular at which time. We would then compare these topics to an additional data set which relates events that occurred in the world. Thereby, we would be to determine if the most popular topic on YouTube is also the most important event that occurred that time. To determine whether an event is important, we would quantify the number of people affected by the event. We would focus on events occurring only in English-speaking region, since the original data set only includes English YouTube channels. To determine which topics is discussed in each videos we would analyze the tags, the description and the title of videos. This analysis would help us to determine if YouTube truly reflects events occurring in the world and also if it is a diverse source of information. 

Secondly, we would determine whether if a topic is controversial by considering the dislike/like ratio. Indeed, if this ratio is large, it often means that the topics and opinions of a video are controversial. Thereby, we would be able which topics are more controversial and thanks to the previous analysis we will be able to determine whether the most popular topics are also the most controversial. 
This analysis would help us if YouTube is a reliable source of information. Indeed, the more controversial a topic and an opinion are, the less reliable it is, since a lot of people doesn’t agree with it.
